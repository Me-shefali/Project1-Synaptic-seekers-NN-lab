# Project1 Synaptic seekers NN lab
 Project Title: Leaf Image Reconstruction with Deep Autoencoder  Description: This project is about developing a grayscale image leaf dataset gathered from different plants and trees that grow on the MBMU campus. The dataset is developed through manual image acquisition and then undergoes preprocessing operations such as grayscale, resizing, normalization, and noise reduction to provide consistency. A deep autoencoder neural network is trained on the preprocessed dataset to learn compressed representations and correctly reconstruct any random grayscale leaf image from the campus. The project shows the applicability of unsupervised learning in feature compression and image reconstruction with future scope to be developed in plant classification and anomaly detection.
